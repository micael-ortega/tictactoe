# TicTacToe ⭕❌

## Motivation:

After reading a comment somewhere on the internet that highlighted the numerous layers of abstraction present in today's programming, I was inspired to gain more experience with a language that offers both high-level and low-level programming capabilities.

While there are some modern programming languages like Go and Rust that offers a balance between low-level and high-level programming, I personally appreciate the Renaissance flavor of C++.

Having a solid understanding of C++ will improve my programming skills, enabling me to archieve my careers goals in the near future.

This tic tac toe game is an application of my studies in C++ and it's being a joy.
